We provide full open source code for our front end.
If anyone wants to make a new UI, different color theme, or help on GE's current ui, we fully support it.
We do have a few requirements that must be followed.

First, you can publish on any app store you want. You can charge for your product.
Second, all in app purchases must be validated on our server only.
All in app purchases must only be executed through our server and app.
Third, you must use the form provided in our app for paypal.
You may not use any other form of in app purchases besides what is listed here.
Here is the link to our open source files: [https://github.com/ddialer/GE].

To all users using other front end applications besides Galactic Empires: Universe.
We take no responsibility or offer any support of their software.
You need to contact them, and only them with any issues.
We offer no refunds of any sort as a result from their programs.
We only support and offer refunds for our official interface.

Note to third party users. If we make updates to the official front end files,
it may cause third party interfaces to malfunction or stop working altogether.
In that case you will need to wait for them to update their interface, or use ours temporarily.
Again, we will offer no refund for any issues caused by their software.
